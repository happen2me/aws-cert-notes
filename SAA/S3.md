## S3 Classes

### Standard

- 4 9's availability
- 11 9's
- for frequent access
- for most workload

### S3 Standard-Infrequent Access

- Infrequent access, but **fast retrieval**.

- Suitable for long-term storage, backups and data store for disaster recovery files.
- 3 9's availability, 11 9's durability

### S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access

- 20% cheaper than standard-IA

- 99.95% availability, 11 9's durability

### Glacier

Cheap, very infrequent, pay every access, only for archive data

4 9's + 11 9's

- Option 1: Glacier
  - Long-term data archiving
  - retrival times: 1 min to 12 hours
- Option 2: Glacier Deep Archive
  - Rarely accessed
  - retrival times: 12 hours by default (等12小时)

## S3 Intelligent Tiering

**Autimatically** moves between frequent accessed and infrequent types.

3 9's + 11 9's

## Lifecycle Management

Automates moving between different storage tiers. Thereby maximizing co

### Combined with Versioning

Move different versions to different tiers.

## S3 Object Lock and Glacier Vault Lock

#### S3 Object Lock

- can be used to store objects using a **write once, read many (WORM)** model.

  help prevent object from being modified for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.

- Can be used to achieve WORM, or add an extra layer of protection against object changes and deletion

#### Governance Mode (a s3 object lock mode)

In governance modem users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions

protect objects against being deleted by most users, still grant some to alter the retention settings or delete them.

#### Compliance Mode (another)

Can't be alterned by any.

#### Retention Periods

protects an object version for a fixed amount of time.

stored in version metadata

object can be alterned after rentention period

#### Legal Holds

when placed on an object version, it prevents alternation. It doesn't have associated retention period and remains effect until removed.

can be placed or removed with `s3:PutObjectLegalHold`
