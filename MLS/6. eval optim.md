# Evaluation and Optimization

### Offline Validation and Online Validation

**Offline**: Validation using test data

**Online**: Validation under real-world scenario. i.e. canary deployment, A/B test

### Evaluate Model Accuracy

**Prevent Overfitting**

- More data
- Early stop
- sprinkle in some noise
- regulate
- ensemble
- Ditch some features

### Regression Accuracy - Measured by RMSE

**Residual**: actual - predicted

**Type I Error**: False Positive

**Type II Error**: False Negative

### Model Tuning

**Bayesian Reasioning**

Try to avoid costly iteration by focusing on what hyper parameter value is likely to give more improvement.
