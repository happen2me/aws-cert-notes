# Modeling

### Data Preparation

1. Randomize
2. split into training and testing
   - Split time series data
     - i.e. use the period from last few months
   - How to check data randomness
     - Use k-fold and check whether the error rates of each rounds are virtually the same

### SageMaker Modeling

### SageMaker Training

**Create Training  Job API**

- AWS has elastic container repository
- It has training and inference images
- SageMaker Algorithms:
  - channel name: distinguish train and inference
  - registry path: \<tag\> represents version
    - :1 stable
    - :latest
  - Input mode: file or pipe

Tips:

The combination of using the protobuf recordIO format and pipe mode will result in improved performance for I/O-bound algorithms because the  data can be streamed directly from S3 versus having to be first copied  to the instance locally.
